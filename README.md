# Dev Landing Page

A minimal introductory page for developers. Feel free to make yours!

### Application

Keeping responsiveness in mind, I have developed this app which can fit in all the devices - PCs to mobile devices.

<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td><b style="font-size:14px">Desktop view</b></td>
    <td><b style="font-size:14px">Mobile view</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
    <td style="width: 50%">
    <img src="public/images/home-page-desktop.png" alt="desktop-view"/>
    </td>
    <td style="width: 50%; height: 250px"><img src="public/images/home-page-mobile.png" alt="mobile-view"/></td>
 </tr>
</table>
